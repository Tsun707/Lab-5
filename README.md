Cleaning up the coding 
Make srue HTML5 Skeleton Structure is correct. 
  We never use <br> or <hr> to achieve line spacing. That is achieved using css. In fact, never use them as you are bound to use them incorrectly.
  Do the images have proper alt tags? Watch this video to learn the incredible SEO value of good alt tags (Hint: “Your alt tags will not match the final.html tags”).
  We only use empty lines of code between semantic groupings of code. Like between <head> and <body>, or between <section>s.
  Check to see if there are any obsolete <b> or <i> tags. Change them to the updated, semantic tags.
  There should be no space after the = sign in our attributes. Specifically, our links should be <a href="index.html"> and not <a href = "index.html".
  There should be no space after html elements. Specifically, our p elements should be <p>Hello World</p> and not <p>    Hello World    </p>.
  Our links to files in our own repository do not need to start with (./). Specifically, href links should be href="folder/file.html" and not href="./   folder/file.html".
